#include "Maker_LED_Matrix.h"       //First, we have to include library to our sketch!
//Then we make an object to a class. We call this object matrix, but you can name it whatever you want. But remember to use that name instead od matrix in rest of the code!
//If you're using Maker LED Matrix 2 (with resolution of 32x9) than use this
//Maker_LED_Matrix matrix(MAKER_LED_MATRIX_2);

//...otherwise use this
Maker_LED_Matrix matrix(MAKER_LED_MATRIX_2);
